# Chronic-Kidney-Disease--Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA
This project focuses on analyzing clinical data to identify patterns and correlations associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Using Python’s data science stack, the project explores patient demographics, blood chemistry, and physiological indicators to understand how these factors relate to the presence of the disease.
# 🚀 Overview
The dataset contains 400 records with 24 features (including blood pressure, albumin, blood glucose, etc.) and a target class indicating the presence of CKD. This analysis cleans the data, handles missing values, and visualizes key insights.
# 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** * Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and cleaning.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Static data visualization.

**Plotly:** Interactive visualizations for deeper data exploration.
# 📊 Key Features of the Analysis
**1.Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and fixing data types for numerical and categorical columns.

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Distribution analysis of features like hemoglobin, albumin, and blood pressure.
- Correlation heatmaps to find relationships between variables (e.g., Blood Urea vs. Serum Creatinine).

- Comparison of health metrics between CKD and Non-CKD patients.

**3.Data Preprocessing:** Preparing features (x) and target labels (y) for potential machine learning modeling.
# 📈 Insights
- Visualizations reveal significant differences in hemoglobin levels and specific gravity between healthy and diseased groups.

- The project highlights which clinical factors are most strongly correlated with kidney dysfunction.
